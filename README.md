  *  ex. image carosel

Must have a polished frontend / UI 
  *  nice theme colors, borders, linking

Must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, naming)
  *  use of functions?, organized code (use of global variables, multiple JS files, separate files for CSS & JS, naming conventions)

<!-- // Presentation Requirments // -->

You will also be responsible for preparing a 10 minute presentation.

This will be a formal presentation. 

One in which you explain in detail:

  *  Your overall application’s concept

  *  The motivation for its development
        * common interests

  *  Your design process

  *  The technologies you used (and briefly how they work)

  *  A demonstration of its functionality

  *  Directions for future development

Treat the presentation seriously! 

Talking intelligently about tech > doing tech sometimes. 

Use a visual aid / slideshow


<!-- // Grade Metrics // -->

* Concept

* Design

* Functionality

* Collaboration
    *  branches you made, pull requests, commits

* Presentation


<!-- // Awards // -->

* Most Awe-Inspiring

* Most Useful

* Most Creative

* Best Use of Tech

* Best UI/UX

* Most Hilarious

* Most Disruptive - (Uber disruptive to taxi industry)

* Most Socially Conscious


<!-- // API Suggestion // -->

Stick to APIs that do all of the following:

* Allows CORS (cross origin resource sharing - both http & https)
    * http
    * https - more secure

* Simple or no authentication
    * api key, GET method - keep it simple

* JSON response returned
    * some may return xml - we havent learned this (AVOID)

* Well documented (is the documentation easy to understand)

<!-- // Tools to Utilize // -->
* create branch - git checkout -b (name)
* GitHub Pull Requests
* GitHub Issues
* Trello

// Project Examples //

* Event Searcher

    Users type in the name of their favorite sporting team.

    Then using the SeatGeek API, your web application points them to the next game and location where the team is playing.

    The web application also provides them a link to Ebay where they can purchase memorabilia associated with the team.

* UN Data API

    Use the Unofficial UN Data API to search a user specified country’s health records.

    Then use a secondary data source (Google Maps, Flickr, YouTube, etc.) to provide additional context or data.

    Examples: Per Capita Govt Expenditures on Health, # of Physicians, Deaths due to HIV, Malaria Cases etc, low birth weight newborns

* Facial Recognition

    Use the Face++ API

    Allow users to provide a URL link to a facial image then provide viewers with information on the image’s gender, race, whether they are wearing glasses, and their age

    Use Firebase to update ALL users of the site about the current search


<!-- // Today's Goals // -->

* Brainstorm possible ideas 

* Begin API Research

* Create an initial draft / sketch of the final design

* Create a short 1 page proposal listing out each of the following:

    Project Title 

    Team Members

    Project Description

    Sketch of Final Product

    APIs to be Used

    Rough Breakdown of Tasks
